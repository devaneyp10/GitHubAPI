# GitHubAPI
CS3012 Software Engineering assignment to retrieve and display data of a GitHub user.
The web app is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used JQuery for html manipulation and event handling and I used Bootstrap library to style the page.
On opening the page you will be introduced to what the app does, and you will be asked to enter in the username of a GitHub user.

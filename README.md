# GitHubAPI
CS3012 Software Engineering assignment to retrieve and display data of a GitHub user.
The web app is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used JQuery & AJAX for html manipulation, event handling and to pull the user information from the server in JSON format. I then used the Bootstrap library to style the page.
On opening the page you will be introduced to what the app does, and you will be asked to enter in the username of a GitHub user.

After typing a username and hitting enter, a modal will appear, showing the GitHub user's information. This informaiton will include the user's name, location, number of followers, number of followings etc. It will then display a visual of the user's contribution graph. It will also provide a list of links to the user's repositories.
